If you want to bring in some ObjC, but you don't want to go through the hassle of creating an independent Xamarin Binding Project, this is your Ticket.

Just add the ObjC code to the embedded XCode project. Make sure you reference it in the external open-source repo if it is OS, rather than copying it in. True Nacho ObjC can be commited here.
